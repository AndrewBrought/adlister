Java Server Pages (JSP)
Technology used to develop dynamic server pages
Provides us a syntax to mix Java code with our HTML
Makes it easier to create HTML pages without having to return from servlet

Servlets                             JSPs
HTML inside of Java              Java inside of HTML

checkout to a specific tag jsp-jstl

JSP Directives
To set conditions that apply to the entire JSP
Syntax
<%@ directive attribute="value" %>

Types of Directives
Page directives: apply to all page
Include directives: include other files
Taglib directives: add tag libraries

JSP TAGS
<% %>
-evaluate a block of java statements

<%= =%>
-outputs the result of an expression

<%-- --%>
-JSP comments

<%! %>
-To define instance variables

home.jsp
JSP logic is being processed on the server side, only html is returned to "client"
<%!String user = "Andrew"; %>
<%!String firstname = "Andrew"; %>
<%!String lastname = "Brought"; %>

<%! int myNumber = 1; %>
<%
    if(myNumber == 1){

    }else{

    }
%>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, <%= user %></h1>


    <h1>Hello, <%= firstname + " " + lastname %></h1>
</body>


JSP Implicit Objects
-request
-response
-out

<%
 String firstname = request.getParameter("firstname");
if(firstname.equals("sophie")){
    //This is how you redirect someone to a different page
        response.sendRedirect("/index.jsp")
}
%>

Expression Language:
EL
makes it easy to access attributes from a request object
Syntax: ${} (like jQuery)
provides us with more implicit objects

<% request.setAttribute("number", 12); %>
Attribute vs parameter
When you send something over as a parameter, it gets returned as a string...
If you want to set a property that is actually an object - you can't
This is why we have the ability to set an Attribute

requests are established in servlet and pass an object from one jsp to another

Parameter's can only return strings
request.getParameter("username") is the same as the Expression Language version ${param.username}

Syntax for accessing attribute on a request
<h3>${'attribute name'}</h3>

This is an instance variable
int myNumber = 1;

this is how we set an attribute on the request
<% request.setAttribute("title", "Home Page"); %>

<c:choose>
(if)
 <c:when test="${boolean_expression_1}">
        <p>boolean_expression_1 was true</p>
    </c:when>

    (else if)
    <c:when test="${boolean_expression_2}">
        <p>boolean_expression_1 was false, and boolean_expression_2 was true</p>
    </c:when>

    (else / default)
    <c:otherwise>
        <p>none of the above tests were true</p>
    </c:otherwise>
</c:choose>
